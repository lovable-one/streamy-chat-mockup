  "Explain how AI works":
    "At a high level, AI works through these key principles:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: AI systems need large amounts of data to learn patterns\n\n2. **Training**: Using algorithms, the system analyzes this data to identify patterns and correlations\n\n3. **Model Building**: These patterns form a model that can make predictions or decisions\n\n4. **Inference**: The trained model can then process new inputs and generate outputs\n\nModern AI, especially deep learning, uses neural networks - computational structures inspired by the human brain. These networks consist of layers of nodes (neurons) that process information and adjust their connections through training.\n\nThe development of AI involves many specialized fields including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and more.",

(koh-mahn tah-lay voo)\n- My name is... = Je m'appelle... (zhuh mah-pel)\n- Thank you = Merci (mehr-see)\n- Please = S'il vous plaÃ®t (seel voo play)\n- Yes/No = Oui/Non (wee/non)\n\nConsistent practice is key to learning any language. Try watching French films with subtitles, listening to French music, or using language learning apps for daily practice. Bonne chance! (Good luck!)",
